<p>Philip J. Fry loves to celebrate February 29th. But, after travelling into the future, he realized that he missed a lot of holidays) He decided to ask his friend Bender to calculate how many times he needs to celebrate a leap year instead of missed ones from 1999 to 2999. Bender wrote a simple algorithm, but Professor Farnsworth just laughed at it because it didn't work! Help Fry calculate how many days he really missed.</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary">Remember that:

<ul>
<li>a year whose number is a multiple of 400 - a leap year (for example, 2400, 2800)</li>
<li>other years, the number of which is a multiple of 100 - non-leap years (2500, 2900, etc.)</li>
<li>other years, the number of which is a multiple of 4 - are leap years (for example, 2996, 2304, etc.)</li>

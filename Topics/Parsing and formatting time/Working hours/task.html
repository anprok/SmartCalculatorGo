<h2>Working hours</h2>
<html><body><p>You work for a company (imagine any you'd like to work for). Before the next vacation, you want to check what salary you have received for the current working period. You have the dates when the period starts and ends, as well as information about the working time per day and the salary per hour.</p>
<p>The dates are input in the format of <code class="java">year-month-day</code>. The salary and the working time are integer numbers without any other symbols. You don't work on weekends and Wednesdays. And on Fridays, you work one hour less than on other days! Now you need to find out the total amount for a given period.</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary">The <code class="java">main()</code> function of your program should take the start and end date strings as input and then parse them to the proper date format. Then, the <code class="java">calculateSalary()</code> function should calculate and print the <code class="java">totalSalary</code> based on the total <code class="java">workingTime</code> and the <code class="java">salaryPerHour</code>.</div></body></html><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">2019-05-01 2019-12-12<br>120 6<br></code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Total: 88320<br></code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 8 seconds</font><br><br>
